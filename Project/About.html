	<p> Hello there, <br>
My name is Daniel Flores, I am from Inglewood CA, and I have a wide variety of passions. From music creating, like with my personal project in progress seen <a href="https://www.bodacious.music.blog"> <u>HERE</u></a>, to taking photographs of scenic views as seen <a href= "20190103_134542.jpg"><u>here</u></a> and <a href= "20180625_144736.jpg"><u>here</u></a> and learning about varied subjects from my college. I had been a self taught guitarist for about 10 years so far having gotten to play in various bands of various genres to being able to teach it myself to several students over my time. I believe my abstract way of visualizing the instrument and the music has allowed me to be able to becoming adept at the craft. With influences from an understanding of the principles of art, even though I myself can't draw, can make connections in ideas of musical composition. I go to El Camino College and have been able to choose from a variety of classes that piqued my interest like linguistic anthropology and photography to philosphoy of religion and weight training and beyond. Gathering knowledge is joyful as sharing it.
